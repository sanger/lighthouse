"""Handle callbacks for registered event types

Event callbacks are additional actions that will be triggered following the creation of an event. They are triggered by
passing a Message to fire_callbacks.

Callbacks are registered in the dictionary EVENT_TYPE_CALLBACKS, which should map an event_type to a callback function.
Event types without callbacks registered will invoke _no_callback, which does nothing.

Callbacks should return a Tuple[bool, List[str]] where the boolean indicates success, and the list contains any errors.
Note that success indicates that the callback was processed correctly, not that it necessarily performed an action. For
example the default _no_callback still returns a success, despite not doing anything, as this is the correct action for
event types without callbacks.
